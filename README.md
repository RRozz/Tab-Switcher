# Tab-Switcher
Buttons to make switching between 2 tabs easier (especially for usb tablet)

It's a modal overlay with buttons and a backboard. You can click on the backboard and drag it to whichever position on your desktop that you would like. Each button (blue and red) switches to the set window for that button. Can also use \[DELETE] key to vascillate between set windows, granted that one of the set windows is currently in focus.

Recommended use: quicker, easier switching between a graphics program (PAINT.NET, Manga Studio EX, Photoshop) and another window (such as an internet browser full of reference pictures). 

I made this because when I clicked on the window in the taskbar, I would accidentally raise the cursor due to using a tablet & pen, but this program makes it easier with a small, portable control that uses simple buttons that WON'T slide and override my click with offering recent programs and to pin the program to the taskbar.

How to Use:
\[Method 1]
1. Click one of the buttons (either blue or red, whichever you want to set to a window)
2. Press space while the Tab Switcher has focus (make sure it has focus; if it already had a registered window then it will open that window and give that window focus)
3. Click into the window you want to register with the button clicked in step 1. If the window was minized when you clicked it, it won't register.

\[Method 2]
1. switch to the window you want to register to a button
2. press ALT + UP to set the window to the blue button, or ALT + DOWN to set the window to the red button

If one of the windows is selected, you can press the DELETE key to switch to the other window
