# Tab-Switcher
Buttons to make switching between 2 tabs easier (especially for usb tablet)

It's a modal overlay with buttons and a backboard. You can click on the backboard and drag it to whichever position on your desktop that you would like. Each button (blue and red) switches to the set window for that button. Can also use \[DELETE] key to vascillate between set windows, granted that one of the set windows is currently in focus.

Recommended use: quicker, easier switching between a graphics program (PAINT.NET, Manga Studio EX, Photoshop) and another window (such as an internet browser full of reference pictures). 

I made this because when I clicked on the window in the taskbar, I would accidentally raise the cursor due to using a tablet & pen, but this program makes it easier with a small, portable control that uses simple buttons that WON'T slide and override my click with offering recent programs and to pin the program to the taskbar.
